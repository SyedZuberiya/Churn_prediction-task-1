# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a given business or service. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a customer will leave the service (churn) based on their characteristics, usage behavior, and other relevant features. The project involves data exploration, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

Customer churn prediction is an essential task for businesses to retain valuable customers and reduce the costs associated with acquiring new ones. In this project, we explore a dataset of customer information to predict whether a customer will churn using machine learning algorithms.

The following steps are carried out:
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Model training using various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
5. Model evaluation using performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Dataset**: The dataset used in this project contains information about customers, such as:
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer.
  - `Gender`: Gender of the customer.
  - `Age`: Age of the customer.
  - `Tenure`: Number of months the customer has been with the service.
  - `Subscription Type`: The type of subscription the customer has.
  - `Monthly Spend`: The amount of money the customer spends per month.
  - `Churn`: A binary column indicating whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).

- **Link to Dataset**: The dataset can be found in `customer_churn.csv` (or update the file path accordingly).
